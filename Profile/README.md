# The Tree

## What is it?

- In this thrilling 2D platformer, players take on the role of monkeys with unique designs, climbing a massive tree to reach the top. The task won't be simple: you'll have to face forest animals like eagles and tigers while staying connected to your teammates by a chain. This mechanic adds an extra layer of difficulty: if one player falls, everyone can fall!

- Your goal is to climb the tree as quickly as possible. Whether you're playing solo or in cooperation (up to 4 players), the challenge is significant. Master attacks like fireballs to defeat your enemies, and be careful not to fall! An online leaderboard will showcase the best times.
